READ(2)                                 Linux Programmer's Manual                                READ(2)



NAME
       read - read from a file descriptor

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);

DESCRIPTION
       read()  attempts  to  read  up to count bytes from file descriptor fd into the buffer starting at
       buf.

       If count is zero, read() returns zero and has  no  other  results.   If  count  is  greater  than
       SSIZE_MAX, the result is unspecified.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, the number of bytes read is returned (zero indicates end of file), and the file posi‐
       tion is advanced by this number.  It is not an error if this number is smaller than the number of
       bytes requested; this may happen for example because fewer bytes are actually available right now
       (maybe because we were close to end-of-file, or because we are reading from a  pipe,  or  from  a
       terminal), or because read() was interrupted by a signal.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is
       set appropriately.  In this case it is left  unspecified  whether  the  file  position  (if  any)
       changes.

ERRORS
       EAGAIN The  file descriptor fd refers to a file other than a socket and has been marked nonblock‐
              ing (O_NONBLOCK), and the read would block.

       EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK
              The file descriptor fd refers to a socket and has been  marked  nonblocking  (O_NONBLOCK),
              and  the read would block.  POSIX.1-2001 allows either error to be returned for this case,
              and does not require these constants to have the same value,  so  a  portable  application
              should check for both possibilities.

       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor or is not open for reading.

       EFAULT buf is outside your accessible address space.

       EINTR  The call was interrupted by a signal before any data was read; see signal(7).

       EINVAL fd  is  attached to an object which is unsuitable for reading; or the file was opened with
              the O_DIRECT flag, and either the address specified in buf, the value specified in  count,
              or the current file offset is not suitably aligned.

       EINVAL fd  was  created  via  a  call to timerfd_create(2) and the wrong size buffer was given to
              read(); see timerfd_create(2) for further information.

       EIO    I/O error.  This will happen for example when the  process  is  in  a  background  process
              group, tries to read from its controlling tty, and either it is ignoring or blocking SIGT‐
              TIN or its process group is orphaned.  It may also occur when there  is  a  low-level  I/O
              error while reading from a disk or tape.

       EISDIR fd refers to a directory.

       Other  errors  may occur, depending on the object connected to fd.  POSIX allows a read() that is
       interrupted after reading some data to return -1 (with errno set to EINTR) or to return the  num‐
       ber of bytes already read.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       On NFS file systems, reading small amounts of data will only update the timestamp the first time,
       subsequent calls may not do so.  This is caused by client side attribute caching, because most if
       not  all NFS clients leave st_atime (last file access time) updates to the server and client side
       reads satisfied from the client's cache will not cause st_atime updates on the  server  as  there
       are  no  server  side  reads.   UNIX semantics can be obtained by disabling client side attribute
       caching, but in most situations this will substantially increase server load and decrease perfor‐
       mance.

       Many  file  systems and disks were considered to be fast enough that the implementation of O_NON‐
       BLOCK was deemed unnecessary.  So, O_NONBLOCK may not be available on files and/or disks.
