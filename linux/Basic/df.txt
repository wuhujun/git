NAME
       df - report file system disk space usage

SYNOPSIS
       df [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the GNU version of df.  df displays the amount of disk space available
       on the file system containing each file name argument.  If no  file  name  is  given,  the  space
       available  on  all  currently mounted file systems is shown.  Disk space is shown in 1K blocks by
       default, unless the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, in which  case  512-byte  blocks
       are used.

       If  an argument is the absolute file name of a disk device node containing a mounted file system,
       df shows the space available on that file system rather than on the file  system  containing  the
       device  node  (which  is  always the root file system).  This version of df cannot show the space
       available on unmounted file systems, because on most kinds of systems doing so requires very non‐
       portable intimate knowledge of file system structures.

OPTIONS
       Show  information  about  the  file  system  on  which  each FILE resides, or all file systems by
       default.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --all
              include dummy file systems

       -B, --block-size=SIZE
              scale sizes by SIZE before printing them.  E.g., `-BM' prints sizes in units of  1,048,576
              bytes.  See SIZE format below.

       --total
              produce a grand total

       -h, --human-readable
              print sizes in human readable format (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)

       -H, --si
              likewise, but use powers of 1000 not 1024

       -i, --inodes
              list inode information instead of block usage

       -k     like --block-size=1K

       -l, --local
              limit listing to local file systems

       --no-sync
              do not invoke sync before getting usage info (default)

       -P, --portability
              use the POSIX output format

       --sync invoke sync before getting usage info

       -t, --type=TYPE
              limit listing to file systems of type TYPE

       -T, --print-type
              print file system type

       -x, --exclude-type=TYPE
              limit listing to file systems not of type TYPE

       -v     (ignored)

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Display values are in units of the first available SIZE from --block-size, and the DF_BLOCK_SIZE,
       BLOCK_SIZE and BLOCKSIZE environment variables.  Otherwise, units default to 1024 bytes  (or  512
       if POSIXLY_CORRECT is set).

       SIZE  may  be (or may be an integer optionally followed by) one of following: KB 1000, K 1024, MB
       1000*1000, M 1024*1024, and so on for G, T, P, E, Z, Y.
