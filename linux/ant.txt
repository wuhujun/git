NAME
       ant - a Java based make tool.


SYNOPSIS
       ant [OPTIONS] [TARGET [TARGET2 [TARGET3] ...]]


DESCRIPTION
       Like  make ant is a tool by which projects can be build. But unlike it,
       ant is based on Java which means it will  run  on  every  platform  for
       which  a  Java Virtual Machine is available. This makes it a great tool
       for building Java software.

       By default it takes information from build.xml which describes the tar‐
       gets.
