从今天开始使用git作为版本管理工具
  感觉使用起来挺方便的一个工具：
GIT(1)                                          Git Manual                                         GIT(1)

     git 的最大优点是可以实现代码的分布式托管，无论在哪里工作，只要有网络，就可以将自己的工作提交上去，非常方便。
     git非常适合开源软件的开发，很多开源项目都被放到github上面了。

NAME
       git - the stupid content tracker

SYNOPSIS
       git [--version] [--help] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p|--paginate|--no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           <command> [<args>]


DESCRIPTION
       Git 是一个快速，稳定，分布式的版本控制系统，并且有非常丰富的命令。 
       Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set
       that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.

       See gittutorial(7) to get started, then see Everyday Git[1] for a useful minimum set of commands,
       and "man git-commandname" for documentation of each command. CVS users may also want to read
       gitcvs-migration(7). See the Git User’s Manual[2] for a more in-depth introduction.

       The <command> is either a name of a Git command (see below) or an alias as defined in the
       configuration file (see git-config(1)).

       Formatted and hyperlinked version of the latest git documentation can be viewed at
       http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/.

OPTIONS
       --version
           Prints the git suite version that the git program came from.

       --help
           Prints the synopsis and a list of the most commonly used commands. If the option --all or -a
           is given then all available commands are printed. If a git command is named this option will
           bring up the manual page for that command.

           Other options are available to control how the manual page is displayed. See git-help(1) for
           more information, because git --help ...  is converted internally into git help ....

       -c <name>=<value>
           Pass a configuration parameter to the command. The value given will override values from
           configuration files. The <name> is expected in the same format as listed by git config
           (subkeys separated by dots).

       --exec-path[=<path>]
           Path to wherever your core git programs are installed. This can also be controlled by setting
           the GIT_EXEC_PATH environment variable. If no path is given, git will print the current
           setting and then exit.

       --html-path
           Print the path, without trailing slash, where git’s HTML documentation is installed and exit.

       --man-path
           Print the manpath (see man(1)) for the man pages for this version of git and exit.

       --info-path
           Print the path where the Info files documenting this version of git are installed and exit.

       -p, --paginate
           Pipe all output into less (or if set, $PAGER) if standard output is a terminal. This overrides
           the pager.<cmd> configuration options (see the "Configuration Mechanism" section below).

       --no-pager
           Do not pipe git output into a pager.

       --git-dir=<path>
           Set the path to the repository. This can also be controlled by setting the GIT_DIR environment
           variable. It can be an absolute path or relative path to current working directory.

       --work-tree=<path>
           Set the path to the working tree. It can be an absolute path or a path relative to the current
           working directory. This can also be controlled by setting the GIT_WORK_TREE environment
           variable and the core.worktree configuration variable (see core.worktree in git-config(1) for
           a more detailed discussion).

       --namespace=<path>
           Set the git namespace. See gitnamespaces(7) for more details. Equivalent to setting the
           GIT_NAMESPACE environment variable.

       --bare
           Treat the repository as a bare repository. If GIT_DIR environment is not set, it is set to the
           current working directory.

       --no-replace-objects
           Do not use replacement refs to replace git objects. See git-replace(1) for more information.

FURTHER DOCUMENTATION
       See the references above to get started using git. The following is probably more detail than
       necessary for a first-time user.

       The git concepts chapter of the user-manual[3] and gitcore-tutorial(7) both provide introductions
       to the underlying git architecture.

       See gitworkflows(7) for an overview of recommended workflows.

       See also the howto[4] documents for some useful examples.

       The internals are documented in the GIT API documentation[5].

LOW-LEVEL COMMANDS (PLUMBING)
       Although git includes its own porcelain layer, its low-level commands are sufficient to support
       development of alternative porcelains. Developers of such porcelains might start by reading about
       git-update-index(1) and git-read-tree(1).

       The interface (input, output, set of options and the semantics) to these low-level commands are
       meant to be a lot more stable than Porcelain level commands, because these commands are primarily
       for scripted use. The interface to Porcelain commands on the other hand are subject to change in
       order to improve the end user experience.

       The following description divides the low-level commands into commands that manipulate objects (in
       the repository, index, and working tree), commands that interrogate and compare objects, and
       commands that move objects and references between repositories.

CONFIGURATION MECHANISM
       Starting from 0.99.9 (actually mid 0.99.8.GIT), .git/config file is used to hold per-repository
       configuration options. It is a simple text file modeled after .ini format familiar to some people.
       Here is an example:

           #
           # A '#' or ';' character indicates a comment.
           #

           ; core variables
           [core]
                   ; Don't trust file modes
                   filemode = false

           ; user identity
           [user]
                   name = "Junio C Hamano"
                   email = "junkio@twinsun.com"


       Various commands read from the configuration file and adjust their operation accordingly. See git-
       config(1) for a list.

IDENTIFIER TERMINOLOGY
       <object>
           Indicates the object name for any type of object.

       <blob>
           Indicates a blob object name.

       <tree>
           Indicates a tree object name.

       <commit>
           Indicates a commit object name.

       <tree-ish>
           Indicates a tree, commit or tag object name. A command that takes a <tree-ish> argument
           ultimately wants to operate on a <tree> object but automatically dereferences <commit> and
           <tag> objects that point at a <tree>.

       <commit-ish>
           Indicates a commit or tag object name. A command that takes a <commit-ish> argument ultimately
           wants to operate on a <commit> object but automatically dereferences <tag> objects that point
           at a <commit>.

       <type>
           Indicates that an object type is required. Currently one of: blob, tree, commit, or tag.

       <file>
           Indicates a filename - almost always relative to the root of the tree structure GIT_INDEX_FILE
           describes.

SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS
       Any git command accepting any <object> can also use the following symbolic notation:

       HEAD
           indicates the head of the current branch.

       <tag>
           a valid tag name (i.e. a refs/tags/<tag> reference).

       <head>
           a valid head name (i.e. a refs/heads/<head> reference).

       For a more complete list of ways to spell object names, see "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in
       gitrevisions(7).

FILE/DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
       Please see the gitrepository-layout(5) document.

       Read githooks(5) for more details about each hook.

       Higher level SCMs may provide and manage additional information in the $GIT_DIR.

TERMINOLOGY
       Please see gitglossary(7).

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Various git commands use the following environment variables:

   The git Repository
       These environment variables apply to all core git commands. Nb: it is worth noting that they may
       be used/overridden by SCMS sitting above git so take care if using Cogito etc.

       GIT_INDEX_FILE
           This environment allows the specification of an alternate index file. If not specified, the
           default of $GIT_DIR/index is used.

       GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY
           If the object storage directory is specified via this environment variable then the sha1
           directories are created underneath - otherwise the default $GIT_DIR/objects directory is used.

       GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES
           Due to the immutable nature of git objects, old objects can be archived into shared, read-only
           directories. This variable specifies a ":" separated (on Windows ";" separated) list of git
           object directories which can be used to search for git objects. New objects will not be
           written to these directories.

       GIT_DIR
           If the GIT_DIR environment variable is set then it specifies a path to use instead of the
           default .git for the base of the repository.

       GIT_WORK_TREE
           Set the path to the working tree. The value will not be used in combination with repositories
           found automatically in a .git directory (i.e. $GIT_DIR is not set). This can also be
           controlled by the --work-tree command line option and the core.worktree configuration
           variable.

       GIT_NAMESPACE
           Set the git namespace; see gitnamespaces(7) for details. The --namespace command-line option
           also sets this value.

       GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES
           This should be a colon-separated list of absolute paths. If set, it is a list of directories
           that git should not chdir up into while looking for a repository directory. It will not
           exclude the current working directory or a GIT_DIR set on the command line or in the
           environment. (Useful for excluding slow-loading network directories.)

       GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM
           When run in a directory that does not have ".git" repository directory, git tries to find such
           a directory in the parent directories to find the top of the working tree, but by default it
           does not cross filesystem boundaries. This environment variable can be set to true to tell git
           not to stop at filesystem boundaries. Like GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES, this will not affect an
           explicit repository directory set via GIT_DIR or on the command line.

   git Commits
       GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL, GIT_AUTHOR_DATE, GIT_COMMITTER_NAME, GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL,
       GIT_COMMITTER_DATE, EMAIL
           see git-commit-tree(1)

   git Diffs
       GIT_DIFF_OPTS
           Only valid setting is "--unified=??" or "-u??" to set the number of context lines shown when a
           unified diff is created. This takes precedence over any "-U" or "--unified" option value
           passed on the git diff command line.

       GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF
           When the environment variable GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF is set, the program named by it is called,
           instead of the diff invocation described above. For a path that is added, removed, or
           modified, GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF is called with 7 parameters:

               path old-file old-hex old-mode new-file new-hex new-mode

           where:

       <old|new>-file
           are files GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF can use to read the contents of <old|new>,

       <old|new>-hex
           are the 40-hexdigit SHA1 hashes,

       <old|new>-mode
           are the octal representation of the file modes.

           The file parameters can point at the user’s working file (e.g.  new-file in "git-diff-files"),
           /dev/null (e.g.  old-file when a new file is added), or a temporary file (e.g.  old-file in
           the index).  GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF should not worry about unlinking the temporary file --- it is
           removed when GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF exits.

           For a path that is unmerged, GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF is called with 1 parameter, <path>.

   other
       GIT_MERGE_VERBOSITY
           A number controlling the amount of output shown by the recursive merge strategy. Overrides
           merge.verbosity. See git-merge(1)

       GIT_PAGER
           This environment variable overrides $PAGER. If it is set to an empty string or to the value
           "cat", git will not launch a pager. See also the core.pager option in git-config(1).

       GIT_EDITOR
           This environment variable overrides $EDITOR and $VISUAL. It is used by several git comands
           when, on interactive mode, an editor is to be launched. See also git-var(1) and the
           core.editor option in git-config(1).

       GIT_SSH
           If this environment variable is set then git fetch and git push will use this command instead
           of ssh when they need to connect to a remote system. The $GIT_SSH command will be given
           exactly two arguments: the username@host (or just host) from the URL and the shell command to
           execute on that remote system.

           To pass options to the program that you want to list in GIT_SSH you will need to wrap the
           program and options into a shell script, then set GIT_SSH to refer to the shell script.

           Usually it is easier to configure any desired options through your personal .ssh/config file.
           Please consult your ssh documentation for further details.

       GIT_ASKPASS
           If this environment variable is set, then git commands which need to acquire passwords or
           passphrases (e.g. for HTTP or IMAP authentication) will call this program with a suitable
           prompt as command line argument and read the password from its STDOUT. See also the
           core.askpass option in git-config(1).

       GIT_FLUSH
           If this environment variable is set to "1", then commands such as git blame (in incremental
           mode), git rev-list, git log, and git whatchanged will force a flush of the output stream
           after each commit-oriented record have been flushed. If this variable is set to "0", the
           output of these commands will be done using completely buffered I/O. If this environment
           variable is not set, git will choose buffered or record-oriented flushing based on whether
           stdout appears to be redirected to a file or not.

       GIT_TRACE
           If this variable is set to "1", "2" or "true" (comparison is case insensitive), git will print
           trace: messages on stderr telling about alias expansion, built-in command execution and
           external command execution. If this variable is set to an integer value greater than 1 and
           lower than 10 (strictly) then git will interpret this value as an open file descriptor and
           will try to write the trace messages into this file descriptor. Alternatively, if this
           variable is set to an absolute path (starting with a / character), git will interpret this as
           a file path and will try to write the trace messages into it.

DISCUSSION
       More detail on the following is available from the git concepts chapter of the user-manual[3] and
       gitcore-tutorial(7).

       A git project normally consists of a working directory with a ".git" subdirectory at the top
       level. The .git directory contains, among other things, a compressed object database representing
       the complete history of the project, an "index" file which links that history to the current
       contents of the working tree, and named pointers into that history such as tags and branch heads.

       The object database contains objects of three main types: blobs, which hold file data; trees,
       which point to blobs and other trees to build up directory hierarchies; and commits, which each
       reference a single tree and some number of parent commits.

       The commit, equivalent to what other systems call a "changeset" or "version", represents a step in
       the project’s history, and each parent represents an immediately preceding step. Commits with more
       than one parent represent merges of independent lines of development.

       All objects are named by the SHA1 hash of their contents, normally written as a string of 40 hex
       digits. Such names are globally unique. The entire history leading up to a commit can be vouched
       for by signing just that commit. A fourth object type, the tag, is provided for this purpose.

       When first created, objects are stored in individual files, but for efficiency may later be
       compressed together into "pack files".

       Named pointers called refs mark interesting points in history. A ref may contain the SHA1 name of
       an object or the name of another ref. Refs with names beginning ref/head/ contain the SHA1 name of
       the most recent commit (or "head") of a branch under development. SHA1 names of tags of interest
       are stored under ref/tags/. A special ref named HEAD contains the name of the currently
       checked-out branch.

       The index file is initialized with a list of all paths and, for each path, a blob object and a set
       of attributes. The blob object represents the contents of the file as of the head of the current
       branch. The attributes (last modified time, size, etc.) are taken from the corresponding file in
       the working tree. Subsequent changes to the working tree can be found by comparing these
       attributes. The index may be updated with new content, and new commits may be created from the
       content stored in the index.

       The index is also capable of storing multiple entries (called "stages") for a given pathname.
       These stages are used to hold the various unmerged version of a file when a merge is in progress.
